# Kaggle: Intro to Programming

Welcome to my repository of work from the **Kaggle Intro to Programming** course! This course has helped me build foundational skills in Python and programming, and each notebook in this repo reflects my learning progress.

---

## ðŸ“š Course Overview

- **Platform:** Kaggle Learn  
- **Course name:** Intro to Programming  
- **Why Iâ€™m doing this:**  
  To strengthen my basics in programming, get comfortable with Python syntax, data types, control flow, and build confidence for more advanced data science & machine learning projects.

## ðŸ›  What Youâ€™ll Find Here

Each folder corresponds to a lesson/topic in the course. Notebooks include exercises, challenges, and hands-on practice.

| Lesson | Notebook(s) | What I Learned |
|---|---|---|
| Variables & Types | `exercise-variables.ipynb` | Introduction to numbers, strings, basic operations, type conversion |
| Arithmetic & Expressions | `exercise-arithmetic.ipynb` | Performing arithmetic operations, operator precedence, writing expressions |
| Conditionals & Logic | `exercise-logic.ipynb` | `if/else`, logical operators, branching logic |
| Loops & Iteration | `exercise-loops.ipynb` | Writing `for` loops, `while` loops, iterating over data |
| Functions & Modular Code | `exercise-functions.ipynb` | Defining functions, passing arguments, returning values |

## âœ… My Progress / Results

- Built comfort with Pythonâ€™s core features (e.g. loops, conditionals, functions)  
- Reflected on mistakes: (e.g. got tripped by type conversion; practiced reading error messages)  
- Key takeaway: (e.g. how to structure code cleanly, how small pieces like functions help with readability)

---

## ðŸ”­ Next Steps

- Apply what I learned by doing small projects (e.g. calculator, text-based game)  
- Move on to Kaggleâ€™s **Data Visualization** or **Pandas** courses  
- Start a mini-project that uses data cleaning and basic plots
